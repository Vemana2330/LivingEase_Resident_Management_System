# LivingEase_Resident_Management_System

## Project Desciption
The Resident Management System aims to streamline operations in gated communities by integrating various essential services into a unified platform. It focuses on automating processes such as amenity bookings, maintenance requests, pest control, and delivery logistics. The system seeks to enhance operational efficiency, improve resident satisfaction, and facilitate seamless collaboration among residents, administrators, and service providers.
